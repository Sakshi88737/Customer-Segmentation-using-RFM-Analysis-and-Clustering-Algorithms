# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis-and-Clustering-Algorithms

### Problem Statement:

With the growing need of businesses, it is essential to understand the customer behaviour to have a competitive edge in the market. In the world of data driven decision making which is an important factor that helps businesses to grow, gain customer satisfaction and increase their revenue, Customer Segmentation provides a systematic approach to divide the customer base into various distinct groups on the basis on various factors like geographic, demographics, behavioural etc. Same market features are shared by the customers in the same segment. This helps businesses to tailor marketing strategies, personalised marketing, resource allocation based on these segments, provide customer services according to the needs and requirements of each segment. 


### Objectives:

1. To enhance the understanding of customer behaviours and purchasing patterns through comprehensive data analysis and segmentation.
2. Segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values to better understand their purchasing behavior.
3. To apply clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) to refine customer segments based on RFM scores.
4. To compare and evaluate the performance of different clustering techniques using metrics like the Silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin Index to determine the most effective method for customer segmentation.
5. To create clear and informative visualizations of customer segments and their characteristics to facilitate better communication and strategic planning for businesses.
